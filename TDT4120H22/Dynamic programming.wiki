= Dynamic programming =

1. Characterize the structure of an optimal solution.
2. Recursively define the value of an optimal solution.
3. Compute the value of an optimal solution, typically in a bottom-up fashion.
4. Construct an optimal solution form computed information.

== Elements of dynamic programming ==

=== Optimal substructure ===

A problem exhibits _*optimal substructure*_ if an optimal solution contains within it optimal solutions to subproblems.

=== Overlapping subproblems ===

When a recursive algorithm revisits the same problem repeatedly,
we say that the optimization problem has _*overlapping subproblems*_.

=== Reconstructing an optimal solution ===

=== Memoization ===

Recursive top-down strategy, but with memory.
