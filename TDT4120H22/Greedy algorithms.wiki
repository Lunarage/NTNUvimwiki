= Greedy algorithms =

For many optimization problems,
using dynamic programming to determine the best choices is overkill,
and simpler, more efficient algorithms will do.

A _*greedy algorithm*_ always makes the choice that looks best at the moment.
That is, it makes a locally optimal choice in the hope that this choice leads to a globally optimal solution.

== Elements of the greedy strategy ==

=== Greedy-choice property ===

You can assemble a globally optimal solution by making locally optimal choices.
