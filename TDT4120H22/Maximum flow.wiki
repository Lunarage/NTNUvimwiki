== Flow networks ==

A _*Flow network*_ $G = (V, E)$ is a directed graph in which each edge $(u, v) \in E$
has a nonnegative _*capacity*_ $c(u, v) \geq 0$.
We further require that if $E$ contains an edge $(u, v)$,
then there is no edge $(v, u)$ in the reverse direction.
If $(u, v) \notin E$, then for convenience we define $c(u,v) = 0$,
and we disallow self-loops.
Each network contains two distinguished vertices: a _*source*_ $s$ and a _*sink*_ $t$.

A _*flow*_ in $G$ is a real-valued function $f: V \times V \to \R$
that satisfies the following two properties:

* The flow from one vertex to another must be nonnegative and must not exceed the given capacity.
* The total flow into a vertex other than the source and sink must equal the total flow out of that vertex.
