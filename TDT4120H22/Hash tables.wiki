== Hash functions ==

A good hash function satisfies (approximately) the assumption of independent uniform hashing:
each key is equally likely to hash to any of the m slots,
independently of where any other keys have hashed to.

What does "equally likely" mean here?

If the hash function is fixed,
any probabilities would have to be based on the probability distribution of the input keys.

=== Static hashing ===

$h(k)$ is the hash function, 
$k$ is the key, 
$m$ is the number of slots, 
$A$ is a constant

==== The division method ====

{{$
h(k) = k\ \textrm{mod}\ m
}}$

==== The multiplication method ====

{{$
h(k) = \lfloor m\ (kA\ \textrm{mod}\ 1)\rfloor
}}$
