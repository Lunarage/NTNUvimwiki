== Heaps ==

The *_(binary) heap_* data structure is an array object that we can view as a nearly complete binary tree.

In a *_max-heap_*, the *_max-heap property_* is that for every node $i$ other than the root,

{{$
A[{\rm P{\small ARENT}}(i)] \geq A[i]
}}$

that is, the value of a node is at most the value of its parent.

{{$
\begin{aligned}
& {\rm P{\small ARENT}}(i) \\
& \qquad{\bf return}\ \lfloor i/2 \rfloor \\
& {\rm L{\small EFT}}(i) \\
& \qquad{\bf return}\ 2i \\
& {\rm R{\small IGHT}}(i) \\
& \qquad{\bf return}\ 2i + 1 \\
\end{aligned}
}}$

== Priority Queues ==

A _*priority queue*_ is a data structure for maintaining a set _S_ of elements,
each with an associated value called a _*key*_.
A _*max-priority queue*_ supports the following operations:

* ${\rm I{\small NSERT}}(S, x, k)$
* ${\rm M{\small AXIMUM}}(S)$
* ${\rm E{\small XTRACT} \hyp M{\small AX}}(S)$
* ${\rm I{\small NCREASE} \hyp K{\small EY}}(S, x, k)$
