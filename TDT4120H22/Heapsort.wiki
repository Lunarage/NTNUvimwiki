== Heaps ==

The *_(binary) heap_* data structure is an array object that we can view as a nearly complete binary tree.

In a *_max-heap_*, the *_max-heap property_* is that for every node $i$ other than the root,

{{$
A[{\rm P{\small ARENT}}(i)] \geq A[i]
}}$

that is, the value of a node is at most the value of its parent.
