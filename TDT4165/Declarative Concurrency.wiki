= Declarative Concurrency =

Some programs are best written as a set of activities that execute independently.
Such programs are called concurrent.
Concurrency is essential for programs that interact with their environment,
e.g. for agents, graphical user interface (GUI) programming, operating system (OS) interaction.
Concurrency also lets a program be organized in parts
that execute independently and interact only when needed,
i.e., client/server and producer/consumer programs.
