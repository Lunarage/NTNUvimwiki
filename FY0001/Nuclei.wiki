== Radioactivity ==

Radioactive substances emit three kinds of rays:
* alpha rays (α), helium nuclei
* beta rays (β), electrons
* gamma rays (γ), electromagnetic radiation

=== Alpha Decay ===

The alpha particle consists of two protons and two neutrons;
it has the same structure as the helium nucleus, $\isotope{He}{4}$.

Two examples:
{{$
\isotope{U}{238} \to \isotope{Th}{234} + \alpha
}}$
{{$
\isotope{Ra}{226} \to \isotope{Rn}{222} + \alpha
}}$

=== Beta Decay ===

The free neutron is unstable, and it decays into a proton, an electron, and an anti-neutrino.

{{$
  n \to p + e^- + \bar{\nu}
}}$

Two examples:
{{$
  \isotope{Co}{60} \to \isotope{Ni}{60} + e^- + \bar{\nu}
}}$
{{$
  \isotope{C}{14} \to \isotope{N}{14} + e^- + \bar{\nu}
}}$

=== Gamma Emission ===

Excess energy form alpha or beta decay as electromagnetic radiation.

== The Law of Radioactive Decay ==

{{$
  n = n_0\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{t/t_{1/2}}
}}$
where $n$ is the number of nuclei, $n_0$ is the original number of nuclei and $t_{1/2}$ is the half-life.
