= Newton's Laws =

== Newton's First Law ==

    A body at rest remains at rest, and a body in motion continues to move at constant velocity
    unless acted upon by a force.

== Newton's Second Law ==

{{$
\Sigma F = ma
}}$

== The Combination of Forces ==

{{$
a = \frac{1}{m}\Sigma F
}}$

== Newton's Third Law ==

    Whenever a body exerts a force on another body,
    the latter exerts a force of equal magnitude and opposite direction on the former.

== Kinds of Forces; Weight and Normal Force ==

== Motion With a Constant Force ==

== Friction ==

{{$
f_k = \mu_k N
}}$

== Restoring Force of a Spring ==

{{$
F = -kx
}}$

== Force for Uniform Circular Motion ==

Centripetal Force

{{$
F = ma = \frac{mv^2}{r} = m\omega^2r
}}$
