= Newton's Laws =

== Newton's First Law ==

    A body at rest remains at rest, and a body in motion continues to move at constant velocity
    unless acted upon by a force.

== Newton's Second Law ==

{{$
\Sigma F = ma
}}$

Where _F_ is force, _m_ is the inertial mass and _a_ is the acceleration.

== The Combination of Forces ==

{{$
a = \frac{1}{m}\Sigma F
}}$

== Newton's Third Law ==

    Whenever a body exerts a force on another body,
    the latter exerts a force of equal magnitude and opposite direction on the former.

== Kinds of Forces; Weight and Normal Force ==

== Motion With a Constant Force ==

== Friction ==

{{$
f_k = \mu_k N
}}$

Where $\mu_k$ is the coefficient of static friction and _N_ is the normal force.

== Restoring Force of a Spring ==

{{$
F = -kx
}}$

Where _x_ is the displacement and _k_ is the spring constant.

== Force for Uniform Circular Motion ==

Centripetal Force

{{$
F = ma = \frac{mv^2}{r} = m\omega^2r
}}$

Where _r_ is the radius, _v_ is the linear velocity, and $\omega$ is the angular velocity.
