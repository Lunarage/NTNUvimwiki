= Quanta of Light =

== Blackbody Radiation ==

A body with a perfectly absorbing (and emitting) surface is called a blackbody.

== Energy Quanta ==

In an oscillator of frequency $f$, the only permitted values of energy are
{{$
  E = 0, hf, 2hf, \dots, nhf, n \in \N
}}$
All other values of energy are forbidden!

*Planck's constant ❤️*
{{$
  h = 6.63 \cdot 10^{-34}~\mathrm{J \cdot s}
}}$

The distribution of energy in the spectrum of Blackbody radiation has a maxima at a wavelength.

*Wien's Law*
{{$
  \lambda_{\text{max}} = \frac{2.90 \cdot 10^{-3}~\mathrm{m \cdot K}}{T}
}}$

== Photons and the Photoelectric Effect ==

The work function of a metal, designated $\phi$.

{{$
  K = hf - \phi
}}$

According to this equation, a minimum frequency is required to achieve the ejection of an electron.
This minimum frequency, called the threshold frequency corresponds to the ejection of an electron of zero kinetic energy.
