*Electric field in uniform wire*
{{$
E = \frac{\Delta V}{l}
}}$

*Electric current*
{{$
I = \frac{\Delta q}{\Delta t}
}}$

*Resistance in terms of resistivity*
{{$
R = \rho\frac{l}{A}
}}$

*Increase of resistance with temperature*
{{$
\Delta R = \alpha R_0 \Delta T
}}$

*Ohm's Law*
{{$
I = \frac{\Delta V}{R}
}}$
