= Electrostatic Potential and Energy =

== TL;DR ==

* *Definition of electrostatic potential*: $V = \frac{U}{q}$
* *Potential energy of two point charges*: $U = k_e\frac{qq'}{r}$
* *Electrostatic potential of point charge*: $V = k_e\frac{q'}{r}$

== The Electrostatic Potential ==

{{$
V = U/q
}}$
where $V$ is the electrostatic potential, $U$ is the electric potential energy, and $q$ is the electric charge.
