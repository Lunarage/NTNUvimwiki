Law of universal gravitation

{{$
  F = G\frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}
}}$

Where $m_1$ and $m_2$ are the masses of two particles and $r$ is the distance between them.

Gravitational constant

{{$
  G = 6.67 \times 10^{-11} \mathrm{Nm^2kg^{-2}}
}}$

== The Measurement of G ==

== Circular Orbits ==

Linear velocity in a circular orbit around an object with mass $M$ at distance $r$ from the center of that mass.

{{$
v^2 = \frac{GM}{r}
}}$

== Gravitational Potential Energy ==

Gravitational potential energy

{{$
U = -\frac{GMm}{r}
}}$

Total mechanical energy

{{$
E = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 - \frac{GMm}{r}
}}$
