= Momentum and Collisions =

== Momentum ==

{{$
\vec{p} = m\vec{v}
}}$

{{$
\frac{\Delta\vec{p}}{\Delta t} = \vec{F}
}}$

{{$
\Sigma \vec{p} = [constant]
}}$

{{$
\frac{\Delta \vec{P}}{\Delta t} = \vec{F}_{\mathrm{ext}}
}}$

== Center of Mass ==

{{$
x_{CM} = \frac{\Sigma m_n x_n}{\Sigma m_n}
}}$

*Gravitational potential energy*
{{$
U = Mgy_{CM}
}}$
Where $M$ is the total mass and $y_{CM}$ is the center of mass along the y-axis.

== The Motion of the Center of Mass ==

{{$
\vec{P} = M\vec{v}_{CM}
}}$

{{$
\vec{F}_{\mathrm{ext}} = M\vec{a}_{CM}
}}$

*Kinetic energy of a system*
{{$
K = \Sigma \frac{1}{2}m_n v_n^2
}}$
Simply the sum of of the kinetic energy

== Collisions ==

*Average force*
{{$
\bar{\vec{F}} = \frac{\vec{p}' - \vec{p}}{\Delta t}
}}$
Where $\vec{p}$ is the initial momentum, and $\vec{p}'$ is the final momentum.

*Elastic collision*

A collision in which the kinetic energy before and after is the same is called elastic.

== Elastic Collisions On a Straight Line ==

In an elastic collision of two particles moving along a straight line,
the laws of conservation of momentum and energy
completely determine the final velocities in terms of the initial velocities.

{{$
m_1v_1 + m_2+v_2 = m_1v_1' + m_2+v_2'
}}$
and
{{$
\frac{1}{2} m_1 v_1^2 + \frac{1}{2} m_2 v_2^2 = \frac{1}{2} m_1 v_1^{2\prime} + \frac{1}{2} m_2 v_2^{2\prime}
}}$

== Inelastic Collisions On a Straight Line ==

*Totally inelastic collision*

If the collision is totally inelastic, so a maximum of kinetic energy is lost,
then the conservation of momentum suffices
to determine the velocities of both particles after the collision.

{{$
v_1' = v_2' = v_{CM} = \frac{m_1v_1}{m_1+m_2}
}}$
