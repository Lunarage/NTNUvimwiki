= Security in Computer Networks =

== What Is Network Security ==
Desirable properties of *secure communication*:
* Confidentiality
    - Only sender and receiver should be able to understand the contents of the transmitted message.
* Message integrity
    - Content of communication is not altered.
* End-point authentication
    - Both the sender and receiver should be able to confirm the identity of the other party involved in the communication.
* Operational security

== Symmetric Key Cryptography ==


* Ciphertext-only attack:
* Known-plaintext attack:
    - 
* Chosen-plaintext attack:

== Message Integrity and Digital Signatures ==
=== Cryptographic Hash Functions ===
A hash function takes an input _m_ and computes a string _H(m)_ known as a hash.
A *cryptographic hash function* is required to have the following additional property:
* It is computational infeasible to find any two different messages _x_ and _y_ such that _H(x)_ = _H(y)_.

=== Message Authentication Code (MAC) ===

== Securing TCP Connections: SSL ==
*SSL: Secure Sockets Layer*
*TLS: Transport Layer Security*

Lives in the application layer.

Three Phases:
* Handshake
* Key derivation
* Data transfer

==== Handshake ====

==== Key Derivation ====

==== Data Transfer ====

== Securing Wireless LANs ==
=== Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) ===

1. A wireless host requests authentication by an access point
2. The access point responds to the authentication request with a 128-byte nonce value.
3. The wireless host encrypts the nonce using the symmetric key that it shares with the access point.
4. The access point decrypts the host-encrypted nonce.

WEP bad. Don't use.
