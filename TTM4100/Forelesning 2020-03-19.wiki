= Link layer =
== MAC address ==
* 48-bit
* HEX-notasjon (XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX)

== ARP ==
* Mapping MAC <-> IP
* ARP-tabell caches hos hver klient
* Who has <ip>? Tell <ip>

== Ethernet ==
* Connectionless (No handshaking)
* Unreliable

=== Frame structure ===
* Preamble (8 bytes used to synchronize clock)
* Destination address (6 bytes)
* Source address (6 bytes)
* Type (2 bytes, typisk IP)
* Payload (46-1500 bytes)
* CRC (4 bytes error detection, drops on error)

=== Switches ===
* Store and forward Ethernet frames
* Examine incoming frame's MAC address (intelligent forwarding)
* Transparent (hosts are unaware of presence of switches)
* Self-learning

= Wireless and mobile networks =
* WiFi
* Point-to-point microwave
* Wide-area
* Satellite
