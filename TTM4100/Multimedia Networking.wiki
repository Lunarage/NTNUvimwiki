=== Recovering from Packet Loss ===

==== Forward Error Correction (FEC) ====
The basic idea of FEC is to include redundant information to the original packet stream.

==== Interleaving ====
Shuffle.
Does not increase overhead.
Increases latency.

==== Error Concealment ====
Nothing is really wrong, i swear. Listen to the audio, it works.


== Protocols for Real-Time Conversational Applications ==

=== RTP (Real-Time Transport Protocol) ===
RTP typically runs on top of UDP.

==== RTP Packet Header Fields ====

| Payload type | Sequence number | Timestamp | Synchronization source identifier | Miscellaneous fields |

===== Payload type =====
* 7 bits
* What encoding is used
* Sender can change encoding on the fly

===== Sequence number =====
* 16 bit
* Increments by one for each packet sent

===== Timestamp =====
* 32 bits
* Can be used to reduce jitter

===== Synchronization source identifier (SSRC) =====
* 32 bits
* Identifies the source of the stream
* Randomly chosen by the sender
