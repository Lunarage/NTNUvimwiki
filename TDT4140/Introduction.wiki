== Professional Software Development ==

General set of attributes that are essential characteristics of a professional software system:

    *Acceptability* Software must be acceptable to the type of users which it is designed.
    This means that it must be understandable, usable, and compatible
    with other systems that they use.

    *Dependability and security* Software Dependability includes a range of characteristics
    including reliability, security and safety.
    Dependable software should not cause physical or economic damage in the event of system failure.
    Software has to be secure so that malicious users cannot access or damage the system.

    *Efficiency* Software should not make wasteful use of system resources
    such as memory and processor cycles.
    Efficiency therefore includes responsiveness, processing time, resource utilization etc.

    *Maintainability* Software should be written in such a way that
    it can evolve to meet the changing needs of customers.
    This is a critical attribute because
    software change is an inevitable requirement of a changing business environment.

Four fundamental activities are common to all software processes:
1. Software specification, where customers and engineers define the software that is to be produced
   and the constraints on its operation.
2. Software development, where the software is designed and programmed.
3. Software validation, where software is checked to ensure that it is what the customer requires.
4. Software evolution, where the software is modified
   to reflect changing customer and market requirements.
