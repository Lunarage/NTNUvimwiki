<p>
A <em><span id="Chapter 21 - Data Structures for Disjoint Sets-Disjoint-set operations-disjoint-set data structure"></span><strong id="disjoint-set data structure">disjoint-set data structure</strong></em> maintains a collection \(S = \{S_1, S_2,\dots,S_k\}\) of disjoint dynamic sets.
We can identify each set by a <em><span id="Chapter 21 - Data Structures for Disjoint Sets-Disjoint-set operations-representative"></span><strong id="representative">representative</strong></em>, which is some member of the set.
</p>

<p>
Letting <em>x</em> denote an object, we wish to support the following operations:
</p>
<blockquote>
Make-Set(x) creates a new set whose only member (an thus representative) is <em>x</em>.
Since the sets are disjoint, we require that <em>x</em> not already be in some other set.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Union(x,y) unites the dynamic sets that contain <em>x</em> and <em>y</em>,
say \(S_x\) and \(S_y\), into a new set that is the union of these to sets.
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
Find-Set(x) returns a pointer to the representative of the (unique) set containing <em>x</em>.
</blockquote>

<p>
We perform the three disjoint-set operations as follows.
A Make-Set operation simply creates a tree with just one node.
We perform a Find-Set operation by following parent pointers
until we find the root of the tree.
The nodes visited on this simple path toward the root constitute the <em><span id="Chapter 21 - Data Structures for Disjoint Sets-Disjoint-set forests-find path"></span><strong id="find path">find path</strong></em>.
A Union operation causes the root of one tree to point to the root of the other.
