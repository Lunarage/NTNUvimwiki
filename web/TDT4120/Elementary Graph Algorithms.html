<p>
A graph \(G = (V,E)\) can be represented in two standard ways:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
As a collection of adjacency lists.

<li>
As an adjacency matrix.

</ol>

<div id="Chapter 22 - Elementary Graph Algorithms-Breadth-first search"><h2 id="Breadth-first search" class="header"><a href="#Chapter 22 - Elementary Graph Algorithms-Breadth-first search">Breadth-first search</a></h2></div>

<p>
Given a graph \(G=(V,E)\) and a distinguished <em><span id="Chapter 22 - Elementary Graph Algorithms-Breadth-first search-source"></span><strong id="source">source</strong></em> vertex <em>s</em>,
breadth-first search systematically explores the edges of <em>G</em>
to "discover" every vertex that is reachable from <em>s</em>.
</p>

<p>
It computes the distance (smallest number of edges) from <em>s</em> to each reachable vertex.
</p>

<p>
It also produces a "breadth-first tree" with root <em>s</em>
that contains all reachable vertices.
</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">
def BFS(G,s):                 # Breadth-first search (Graph, root vertex)

    u.color = WHITE           # Mark vertex as unvisited
    u.d = ∞                   # Distance to root vertex
    u.π = None                # No parent (yet)
  s.color = GRAY              # Root is visited
  s.d = 0                     # Distance to itself is 0
  s.π = None                  # Root has no parent
  Q = Queue()                 # Create empty queue
  Q.put(s)                    # Put root vertex in queue
  while not Q.empty():        # Loop trough vertices
    u = Q.get()               # Dequeue a vertex

        v.π = u               # Set vertex parent
        Q.put(v)              # Put vertex in queue
    u.color = BLACK           # Mark vertex as completed

<ol>
<li>
<em><span id="Chapter 22 - Elementary Graph Algorithms-Depth-first search-Classification of edges-Tree edges"></span><strong id="Tree edges">Tree edges</strong></em> are edges in the depth-first forest \(G_π\).
   Edge \((u,v)\) is a tree edge if <em>v</em> was discovered by exploring edge \((u,v)\).

<li>
<em><span id="Chapter 22 - Elementary Graph Algorithms-Depth-first search-Classification of edges-Back edges"></span><strong id="Back edges">Back edges</strong></em> are those edges \((u,v)\) connecting a vertex <em>u</em> to an ancestor <em>v</em> in a depth-first tree.
   We consider self-loops, which may occur in directed graphs, to be back edges.

<li>
<em><span id="Chapter 22 - Elementary Graph Algorithms-Depth-first search-Classification of edges-Forward edges"></span><strong id="Forward edges">Forward edges</strong></em> are those nontree edges \((u,v)\) connecting a vertex <em>u</em> to a descendant <em>v</em> in a depth-first tree.

<li>
<em><span id="Chapter 22 - Elementary Graph Algorithms-Depth-first search-Classification of edges-Cross edges"></span><strong id="Cross edges">Cross edges</strong></em> are all the other edges.
   They can go between vertices in the same depth-first tree,
   as long as one vertex is not an ancestor of the other,
   or they can go between vertices in different depth-first trees.

<p>
A <em><span id="Chapter 22 - Elementary Graph Algorithms-Topological sort-topological sort"></span><strong id="topological sort">topological sort</strong></em> of a dag \(G=(V,E)\) is a linear ordering of all its vertices
such that if <em>G</em> contains an edge \((u,v)\),
then \(u\) appears before \(v\) in the ordering.
