As seen from the Earth, the Sun has an angular diameter of \(0.53°\).
The distance between the Earth and the Sun is \(1.5\times10^{11}\:\mathrm{m}\).
From this, calculate the radius of the Sun.

You travel in your car for 30 minutes at 35 km/h, and then for another 30 minutes at 85 km/h.

The fastest land animal is the cheetah, which runs at a speed of up to 28 m/s.
The second fastest is the antelope, which runs at a speed of up to 24 m/s.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
(a) Suppose that the cheetah begins to chase the antelope.
  If the antelope has a head start of 50 m, how long does it take the cheetah to catch the antelope?
  How far will the cheetah have traveled by this time?

<li>
(b) The cheetah can only maintain its top speed for about 20 s (and then has to rest,
  whereas the antelope can do it for a considerably longer time.
  What is the maximum head start the cheetah can allow the antelope?

</ul>

The driver of an automobile traveling at 95 km/h perceives an obstacle on the road and slams on the brakes.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
(a) Calculate the total stopping distance (in meters).
  Assume that the reaction time of the driver is 0.75 s
  (so there is a time interval of 0.75 s during which the automobile continues at constant speed while the driver gets ready to apply the brakes)
  and that the deceleration of the automobile is \(7.8\:\mathrm{m/s^2}\) when the brakes are applied.

<li>
(b) Repeat the calculation of part (a) for initial speeds of 15, 30, 45, 60, and 75 km/h.
  Make a plot of stopping distance vs initial speed.

</ul>

Radius of the Earth: \(r=6.37\times10^6\:\mathrm{m}\)

<li>
The circumference of a circle: \(C=2 \pi r\)

</ul>

<p>
The distance from a pole to the equator is a quarter of the circle going trough the poles and the equator:
</p>

\[
d = \frac{C}{4}
= \pi \frac{r}{2}
= \pi\frac{6.37\times10^6\:\mathrm{m}}{2}
= 1.00 \times 10^7 \: \mathrm{m}

Fun fact: The metre was at one point in time defined to be a ten-millionth of the distance between the North Pole and the equator along the meridian through Paris.
