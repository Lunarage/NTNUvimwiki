<p>
Elements in a wireless network:<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Wireless host:

<ul>
<li>
Laptop, Tablet, Phone etc.

</ul>
<li>
Wireless links:

<ul>
<li>
Two key characteristics:

<ul>
<li>
Coverage Area

<li>
Link Rate

</ul>
</ul>
<li>
Base station:

<ul>
<li>
Cell Towers, access points

<li>
A host is associated with a base station when

<ol>
<li>
The host is within the wireless communication distance of the base station

<li>
The host uses that base station to relay data between it and the larger network

</ol>
<li>
Handoff: When a host changes base station

</ul>
<li>
Network infrastructure:

<ul>
<li>
The larger network with which a wireless host may wish to communicate

</ul>
</ul>

<p>
We can classify wireless networks according to two criteria: Single-/Multiple-Hop and Infrastructure-based/Infrastructure-less:<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Single-hop, Infrastructure-based:

<ul>
<li>
802.11, 4G etc

<li>
Majority of wireless networks we use in our daily lives

</ul>
<li>
Single-hop, Infrastructure-less:

<ul>
<li>
Bluetooth, ad hoc 802.11 networks

</ul>
<li>
Multi-hop, Infrastructure-based:

<ul>
<li>
Wireless mesh networks

</ul>
<li>
Multi-hop, Infrastructure-less:

<ul>
<li>
mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs), vehicular ad hoc network (VANET)

</ul>
</ul>

<div id="Wireless and Mobile Networks-Wireless Links and Networks Characteristics"><h2 id="Wireless Links and Networks Characteristics" class="header"><a href="#Wireless and Mobile Networks-Wireless Links and Networks Characteristics">Wireless Links and Networks Characteristics</a></h2></div>
<p>
Differences between wireless and wired links:<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Decreasing signal strength:

<ul>
<li>
Electromagnetic radiation attenuates as it passes through matter.

</ul>
<li>
Interference from other sources:

<ul>
<li>
Microwave ovens use 2.4GHz :(

</ul>
<li>
Multipath propagation:

<ul>
<li>
Reflections cause the same signal to take more paths

</ul>
</ul>

<p>
<span id="Wireless and Mobile Networks-Wireless Links and Networks Characteristics-Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)"></span><strong id="Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)">Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)</strong>:<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Relative measurement of the strength of the received signal and noise.

<li>
Usually measured in dB

<li>
Big SNR Good, Small SNR Bad

</ul>

<p>
Bit error rate (BER):<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The probability that a transmitted bit is received in error at the receiver.

</ul>

<p>
Physical-layer characteristics that are important to understand:<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>
For a given modulation scheme, the higher the SNR , the lower the BER.

<ul>
<li>
Less relative noise â†’ Fewer errors

</ul>
<li>
For a given SNR, a modulation technique with a higher bit transmission rate (whether in error or not) will have a higher BER.

<li>
Dynamic selection of the physical-layer modulation technique can be used to adapt the modulation technique to channel conditions.

<ul>
<li>
Adaptive modulation and coding are used in 802.11 and 4G.

</ul>
</ul>

<a href="Link Layer.html#Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA)">CSMA</a> with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA)<br />
Link-layer acknowledgement/retransmission (ARQ)<br />
</p>

<p>
The 802.11 MAC Protocol does not implement collision detection for two important reason:<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The ability to detect collisions requires the ability to send and receive at the same time.

<li>
More importantly, even if the adapter could transmit and receive at the same time, the adapter would still not be able to detect all collisions, due to the hidden terminal problem and fading.

</ul>

<p>
A frame is always transmitted in its entirety.<br />
</p>

<div id="Wireless and Mobile Networks-802.11: 802.11 Wireless LANs-The 802.11 MAC Protocol-Link-layer acknowledgement scheme"><h4 id="Link-layer acknowledgement scheme" class="header"><a href="#Wireless and Mobile Networks-802.11: 802.11 Wireless LANs-The 802.11 MAC Protocol-Link-layer acknowledgement scheme">Link-layer acknowledgement scheme</a></h4></div>
<p>
When a destination receives a frame that passes Â <a href="Link Layer.html#Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)">CRC</a> it waits a short period of time, Short Inter-frame Spacing (SIFS), and then sends back an acknowledgement frame.<br />
If no acknowledgement is received, the frame is retransmitted using CSMA/CA.<br />
If an acknowledgement is not received after some fixed number of retransmissions, the frame is discarded.<br />
</p>

<div id="Wireless and Mobile Networks-802.11: 802.11 Wireless LANs-The 802.11 MAC Protocol-CSMA/CA"><h4 id="CSMA/CA" class="header"><a href="#Wireless and Mobile Networks-802.11: 802.11 Wireless LANs-The 802.11 MAC Protocol-CSMA/CA">CSMA/CA</a></h4></div>
<p>
Suppose that a station has a frame to transmit:<br />
</p>
<ol>
<li>
If initially the station senses the channel idle, it transmits its frame after a short period of time, <span id="Wireless and Mobile Networks-802.11: 802.11 Wireless LANs-The 802.11 MAC Protocol-CSMA/CA-Distributed Inter-frame Space (DIFS)"></span><strong id="Distributed Inter-frame Space (DIFS)">Distributed Inter-frame Space (DIFS)</strong>

<li>
Otherwise, the station chooses a random backoff value using binary exponential backoff and counts down this value after DIFS when the channel is sensed idle. While the channel is sensed busy, the counter value remains frozen.

<li>
When the counter reaches zero, the station transmits the entire frame and then waits for an acknowledgement.

<li>
If an acknowledgement is received, start with a new frame, else backoff and retransmit.

</ol>

The term <em>cellular</em> refers to the fact that the region covered by a cellular network is partitioned into a number of geographic coverage areas, known as <span id="Wireless and Mobile Networks-Cellular Internet Access-Cellular Network Architecture, 2G: Voice Connections to the Telephone Network-cells"></span><strong id="cells">cells</strong>.<br />
</p>

<p>
Each cell contains a <span id="Wireless and Mobile Networks-Cellular Internet Access-Cellular Network Architecture, 2G: Voice Connections to the Telephone Network-base transceiver station (BTS)"></span><strong id="base transceiver station (BTS)">base transceiver station (BTS)</strong> <br />

A GSM network's <span id="Wireless and Mobile Networks-Cellular Internet Access-Cellular Network Architecture, 2G: Voice Connections to the Telephone Network-base station controller (BSC)"></span><strong id="base station controller (BSC)">base station controller (BSC)</strong> will typically service several tens of BTSs.<br />
The role of the BSC is to:<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Allocate BTS radio channels to mobile subscribers.

<li>
Perform <span id="Wireless and Mobile Networks-Cellular Internet Access-Cellular Network Architecture, 2G: Voice Connections to the Telephone Network-paging"></span><strong id="paging">paging</strong> (finding the cell in which a mobile user is resident).

<li>

<p>
The approach taken by the designers of 3G:<br />
Leave the existing core GSM cellular voice network untouched, adding additional cellular data functionality in parallel to the existing cellular voice network.<br />
</p>

<p>
Generalized Packet Radio Service (GPRS) is an early cellular data service in 2G networks.<br />
</p>

<p>
There are two types of nodes in the 3G core network:<br />
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span id="Wireless and Mobile Networks-Cellular Internet Access-3G Cellular Data Networks: Extending the Internet to Cellular Subscribers-3G Core Network-Serving GPRS Support Nodes (SGSNs)"></span><strong id="Serving GPRS Support Nodes (SGSNs)">Serving GPRS Support Nodes (SGSNs)</strong>

<ul>
<li>

<li>
Interacts with the cellular voice network's MSC for that area, providing:

<ul>
<li>
User authorization and handoff

<li>
Maintaining location (cell) information about active mobile nodes

<li>
Performing datagram forwarding between mobile nodes in the radio access network and a GGSN

</ul>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
Acts as a gateway, connecting multiple SGSNs into the larger internet.

<li>

The circuit-switched cellular voice network via an MSC

<li>
The packet-switched Internet via an SGSN

</ul>

<p>
A significant change in 3G UMTS over 2G networks is that rather than using GSM's FDMA/TDMA scheme,<br />
UMTS uses a <a href="Link Layer.html#Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA)">CDMA</a> technique known as Direct Sequence Wideband CDMA (DS-WCDMA)<br />
