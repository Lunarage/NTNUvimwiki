= Chapter 16 - Greedy Algorithms =

A greedy algorithm always make the choice that looks best locally.

== An activity-selection problem ==

== Elements of the greedy strategy ==

=== Greedy-choice property ===

We can assemble a globally optimal solution by making locally optimal (greedy) choices.

=== Optimal Substructure ===

A problem exhibits _*optimal substructure*_ if an optimal solution to the problem
contains within it optimal solutions to subproblems.

=== Greedy versus dynamic programming ===

== Huffman codes ==

=== Prefix codes ===

=== Constructing a Huffman code ===
