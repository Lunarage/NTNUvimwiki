== Stacks and Queues ==

`DELETE` operation:

    The *stack* implements _last-in, first-out_, or *LIFO*, policy.
    The *queue* implements _first-in, last-out_, or *FIFO*, policy.

=== Stacks ===

`INSERT` operation is often called `PUSH` and the `DELETE` operation is often called `POP`.

We can implement a stack of at most _n_ elements with an array $S[1 \dots n]$.
The array has an attribute $S.top$ that indexes the most recently inserted element.

=== Queue ===

`INSERT` operation is called `ENQUEUE` and `DELETE` operation is called `DEQUEUE`.
