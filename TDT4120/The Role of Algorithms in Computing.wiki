== Algorithms ==

Informally, an *algorithm* is any well-defined computational procedure that takes some value, or set of values, as *input* and produces some value, or set of values, as *output*.

Here is how we formally define the *sorting problem*:
{{$
    \textbf{Input:} \text{A sequence of } n \text{ numbers} \langle a_1, a_2, \dots, a_m \rangle
    \\
    \textbf{Output:} \text{A permutation (reordering) } \langle a'_1, a'_2, \dots, a'_n \rangle
}}$

An algorithm is said to be *correct* if, for every input instance, it halts with the correct output.
We say that a correct algorithm *solves* the given computational problem.
