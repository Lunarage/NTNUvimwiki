= Differential Equations =

Separable differential equations
{{$
\frac{dy}{dx} = f(x)g(y)
}}$

== Solving Differential Equations ==

=== Pure-Time Differential Equations ===

{{$
\frac{dy}{dx} = f(x)
}}$

{{$
y(x) = \int f(x) \,dx
}}$

=== Autonomous Differential Equations ===

==== Cases ====

{{$
\frac{dy}{dx} = k(y-a)
}}$

{{$
y(x) = Ce^{kx} + a
}}$

*Exponential Population Growth*

{{$
\frac{dN}{dt} = rN\text{, where } N(0) = N_0
}}$

{{$
N(t) = Ce^{rt} = N_0e^{rt}
}}$

*Restricted Growth*

{{$
\frac{dL}{dt} = k(A-L)
}}$

{{$
L(t) = A\left[1-\left(1-\frac{L_0}{A}\right)e^{-kt}\right]
}}$

*The Logistic Equation*

{{$
\frac{dN}{dt} = rN\left(1-\frac{N}{K}\right)\text{ with } N(0) = N_0
}}$

The quantity $K$ is called the *carrying capacity*, and $r$ is the growth rate.

{{$
N(t) = \frac
  {K}
  {1-e^{-rt}/C}
}}$

{{$
C = \frac
  {N_0}
  {N_0-K}
}}$

{{$
N(t) = \frac{K}{1+(\frac{K}{N_0}-1)e^{-rt}}
}}$

{{$
\lim_{t \to \infty} N(t) = K
}}$

== Equilibria and Their Stability ==

If $\hat{y}$ satisfies

$g(\hat{y})=0$

then $\hat{y}$ is an equilibrium of

$\frac{dy}{dx}=g(y)$

*Stability Criterion*

$\frac{dy}{dx} = g(y)$

$\hat{y}$ is locally stable if $g'(\hat{y}) < 0$

$\hat{y}$ is unstable if $g'(\hat{y}) > 0$
