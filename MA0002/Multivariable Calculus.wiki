= Multivariable Calculus =

== Functions of Two or More Independent Variables ==

== Limits and Continuity ==

=== Limits ===

*Limit Laws for the Two-Dimensional Case*

If $a$ is a constant and if
{{$
\begin{align}
  \lim_{(x,y) \to (x_0,y_0)} & f(x,y) = L_1 \\ & \text{and} \\ \lim_{(x,y) \to (x_0,y_0)} & g(x,y) = L_2
\end{align}
}}$
where $L_1$ and $L_2$ are real numbers, then the following hold:

=== Continuity ===

A function $f(x,y)$ is continuous at $(x_0, y_0)$ if the following hold:
1. $f(x,y)$ is defined at $(x_0, y_0)$
2. $\lim_{(x,y) \to (x_0,y_0)} f(x,y)$ exists.
3. $\lim_{(x,y) \to (x_0,y_0)} f(x,y) = (x_0, y_0)$

== Partial Derivatives ==

*Definition*

If $f$ is a function of two independent variables $x$ and $y$,
the *partial derivative* of $f$ with respect to $x$ is defined by
{{$
  \frac{\partial f(x,y)}{\partial x} = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h,y) - f(x,y)}{h}
}}$
The partial derivative of $f$ withe respect to $y$ is defined by
{{$
  \frac{\partial f(x,y)}{\partial y} = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x,y+h) - f(x,y)}{h}
}}$

*Notation*

$f_x(x,y) = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}$

$f_{yx} = \frac{\partial^2f}{\partial x \partial y} = \frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\right)$

*Computation*

To compute $\frac{\partial f(x,y)}{\partial x}$ we treat $y$ as a constant and differentiate $f$ with respect to $x$.

*Disks are two-dimensional analogues to intervals*

An *open disk* with radius $r$ centered at $(x_0,y_0) \in \mathbb{R}^2$ is the set
{{$
B_r(x_0,y_0) = \left\{ (x,y) \in \mathbb{R}^2 : \sqrt{(x-x_0)^2-(y-y_0)^2} < r \right\}
}}$
A *closed disk* with radius $r$ centered at $(x_0,y_0) \in \mathbb{R}^2$ is the set
{{$
\overline{B}_r(x_0,y_0) = \left\{ (x,y) \in \mathbb{R}^2 : \sqrt{(x-x_0)^2-(y-y_0)^2} \leq r \right\}
}}$

*The Mixed-Derivative Theorem*

If $f(x,y)$ and its partial derivatives $f_x,f_y,f_{xy},f_{yx}$
are continuous on an open disk centered at the point $(x_0,y_0)$, then
{{$
 f_{xy}(x_0,y_0) = f_{yx}(x_0,y_0)
}}$

== Tangent Planes, Differentiability and Linearization ==

=== Functions of Two Variables ===

==== Tangent Planes ====

If the tangent plane to the surface $z = f(x,y)$ at the point $(x_0, y_0, z_0)$ exists,
then the tangent plane has the equation
{{$
z - z_0 = \frac{\partial f(x_0,y_0)}{\partial x}(x-x_0) + \frac{\partial f(x_0,y_0)}{\partial y}(y-y_0)
}}$

    Basically 2d equivalent of a tangent line.

==== Differentiability ====

Suppose that $f(x,y)$ is a function of two independent variables
and that both $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}$ and $\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}$
are defined throughout an open disk containing $(x_0,y_0)$.
    Some circle of inputs where the function works.
Set
{{$
L(x,y) = f(x_0,y_0) + \frac{\partial f(x_0,y_0)}{\partial x}(x-x_0) + \frac{\partial f(x_0,y_0)}{\partial y}(y-y_0)
}}$
    Linearize the function (tangent plane).
Then $f(x,y)$ is differentiable at $(x_0,y_0)$ if
{{$
\lim_{(x,y) \to (x_0,y_0)} \left| \frac{f(x,y) - L(x,y)}{\sqrt{(x-x_0)^2-(y-y_0)^2}} \right| = 0
}}$
    Difference between the actual function and the linearized version divided by the distance from point of linearization.
    The function is differentiable if the linearization and the function agrees at given point.
Furthermore, if $f(x,y)$ is differentiable at $(x_0,y_0)$,
then $z = L(x,y)$ defines the tangent plane to the graph of $f$ at $(x_0,y_0,f(x_0,y_0))$.
We say that $f(x,y)$ is differentiable if it is differentiable at every point of its domain.

*Theorem*

If $f(x,y)$ is differentiable at $(x_0,y_0)$, then $f$ is continuous at $(x_0,y_0)$.

*Sufficient Condition For Differentiability*

Suppose $f(x,y)$ is defined on an open disk centered at $(x_0,y_0)$
and the partial derivativesÂ $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}$ and $\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}$
are continuous on an open disk centered at $(x_0,y_0)$.
Then $f(x,y)$ is differentiable at $(x_0,y_0)$.

==== Linearization ====

Suppose that $f(x,y)$ is differentiable at $(x_0,y_0)$.
The linearization of $f(x,y)$ at $(x_0,y_0)$ is the function
{{$
L(x,y) = f(x_0,y_0) + \frac{\partial f(x_0,y_0)}{\partial x}(x-x_0) + \frac{\partial f(x_0,y_0)}{\partial y}(y-y_0)
}}$
The approximation
{{$
f(x,y) \approx L(x,y)
}}$
is the *standard linear approximation*, or the *tangent plane approximation*, of $f(x,y)$ at $(x_0,y_0)$.

=== Vector-Valued Functions ===

Vector-valued functions $\vec{f}:\mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m$
{{$
\vec{f}(x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n) =
\begin{bmatrix}
  f_1(x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n) \\
  f_2(x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n) \\
  \vdots \\
  f_m(x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n)
\end{bmatrix}
}}$
where $f_i : \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}, i = 1,2,\dots,n$,
are real-valued functions of $n$ independent variables,
then the *Jacobi matrix* is an $m \times n$ matrix of the form
{{$
D\vec{f} =
\begin{bmatrix}
  \frac{\partial f_1}{\partial x_1} & \ldots & \frac{\partial f_1}{\partial x_n} \\
  \vdots & & \vdots \\
  \frac{\partial f_m}{\partial x_1} & \ldots & \frac{\partial f_m}{\partial x_n}
\end{bmatrix}
}}$
The linearization of $\vec{f}$ about the point $(x_1^*, x_2^*, \dots, x_n^*)$ is then
{{$
L(x_1^*, \dots, x_n^*) =
\begin{bmatrix}
  f_1(x_1^*,\dots,x_n^*) \\
  f_2(x_1^*,\dots,x_n^*) \\
  \vdots \\
  f_m(x_1^*,\dots,x_n^*)
\end{bmatrix}
+
D\vec{f}(x_1^*, \dots, x_n^*)
\begin{bmatrix}
  x_1 - x_1^* \\
  \vdots \\
  x_n - x_n^*
\end{bmatrix}
}}$

== More About Derivatives ==

=== The Chain Rule for Functions of Two Variables ===

If $w = f(x,y)$ is differentiable and $x$ and $y$ are differentiable functions of $t$,
then $w$ is a differentiable function for $t$ and
{{$
  \frac{dw}{dt} = \frac{\partial w}{\partial x}\frac{dx}{dt} + \frac{\partial w}{\partial y}\frac{dy}{dy}
}}$

=== Implicit Differentiation ===

If a function $F(x,y)$ is differentiable, with $x = f(x)$ and $y = g(x)$,
and $F(x,y) = 0$ defines $y$ implicitly as a differentiable function of $x$,
Then, at any point where $F_y \neq 0$,
{{$
  \frac{dy}{dx} = -\frac{F_x}{F_y}
}}$

=== Directional Derivatives and Gradient Vectors ===

Assume that $z = f(x,y)$ is a function of two independent variables
and that $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}$ and $\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}$ exist. Then the vector
{{$
  \nabla f(x,y) = \begin{bmatrix}
    \frac{\partial f(x,y)}{\partial x} \\
    \frac{\partial f(x,y)}{\partial y}
  \end{bmatrix}
}}$
is called the gradient of $f$ at $(x,y)$.

The directional derivative of $f(x,y)$ at $(x_0,y_0)$
in the direction of the unit vector $\vec{u}=\begin{bmatrix}u_1 \\ u_2\end{bmatrix}$ is
{{$
  D_{\vec{u}}f(x_0,y_0) = (\nabla f(x_0,y_0)) \cdot \vec{u}
}}$

== Applications ==

=== Maxima and Minima ===

A function $f(x,y)$ defined on a set $D \subset \mathbb{R}^2$
has a *local* (or *relative*) *maximum* at a point $(x_0,y_0)$
if there exists a $\delta > 0$ such that
{{$
  f(x,y) \leq f(x_0,y_0)\;\;\text{for all}\;(x,y) \in B_\delta(x_0,y_0) \cap D
}}$
A function $f(x,y)$ defined on a set $D \subset \mathbb{R}^2$
has a *local* (or *relative*) *minimum* at a point $(x_0,y_0)$
if there exists a $\delta > 0$ such that
{{$
  f(x,y) \geq f(x_0,y_0)\;\;\text{for all}\;(x,y) \in B_\delta(x_0,y_0) \cap D
}}$

    Within a circle where the function is defined:
    if all points around a point of interest is less extreme (higher/lower),
    then the point of interest is a local extremum.

If $f(x,y)$ ha a local extremum at $(x_0,y_0)$
and if $f$ is differentiable at $(x_0,y_0)$, then
{{$
  \nabla f(x_0,y_0) = \begin{bmatrix}0\\0\end{bmatrix}
}}$

    The slope is flat at an extremum.

Suppose the second partial derivatives of $f$
are continuous in a disk centered at $(x_0,y_0)$.
Suppose also that $\nabla f(x_0,y_0) = \begin{bmatrix}0\\0\end{bmatrix}$
Define
{{$
  D = f_{xx}(x_0,y_0)f_{yy}(x_0,y_0) - (f_{xy}(x_0,y_0))^2
}}$
1. If $D > 0$ and $f_{xx}(x_0,y_0) > 0$, then $f$ has a local minimum at $(x_0,y_0)$
2. If $D > 0$ and $f_{xx}(x_0,y_0) < 0$, then $f$ has a local maximum at $(x_0,y_0)$
3. If $D < 0$, then $f$ does not have a local extremum at $(x_0,y_0)$.
   The point $(x_0,y_0)$ is then called a *saddle point*.

==== A Sufficient Condition Based on Eigenvalues ====

The *Hessian matrix*
{{$
\mathrm{Hess}\;f(x_0,y_0) =
\begin{bmatrix}
  \frac{\partial^2f(x_0,y_0)}{\partial x^2}          & \frac{\partial^2f(x_0,y_0)}{\partial y \partial x} \\
  \frac{\partial^2f(x_0,y_0)}{\partial x \partial y} & \frac{\partial^2f(x_0,y_0)}{\partial y^2}
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
  f_{xx}(x_0,y_0) & f_{xy}(x_0,y_0) \\
  f_{yx}(x_0,y_0) & f_{yy}(x_0,y_0)
\end{bmatrix}
}}$

It turns out that the eigenvalues of this matrix
provide a sufficient condition for determining whether
a critical point is a local maximum, local minimum, or neither.

Suppose the second partial derivatives of $f$ are continuous in a disk centered at $(x_0,y_0)$.
Suppose also that $\nabla f(x_0,y_0) = \begin{bmatrix}0\\0\end{bmatrix}$.
Then
1. If the two eigenvalues of $\mathrm{Hess}\;f(x_0,y_0)$ are positive,
   then $f$ has a local minimum at $(x_0,y_0)$.
3. If the two eigenvalues of $\mathrm{Hess}\;f(x_0,y_0)$ are negative,
   then $f$ has a local maximum at $(x_0,y_0)$.
4. If the two eigenvalues of $\mathrm{Hess}\;f(x_0,y_0)$ are of opposite signs,
   then $f$ does not have a local extremum at $(x_0,y_0)$.
   The point $(x_0,y_0)$ is a *saddle point*.

Because we assume that the second partial derivatives of $f$
are continuous in a disk centered at $(x_0,y_0)$. We have
{{$
  \frac{\partial^2 f(x,y)}{\partial x \partial y} =
  \frac{\partial^2 f(x,y)}{\partial y \partial x}
}}$
and the Hessian matrix is
[[Linear Algebra and Analytic Geometry#Linear Algebra and Analytic Geometry#Matrices#Classifications of Matrices#Symmetric Matrices|symmetric]].
The
[[Linear Algebra and Analytic Geometry#Linear Algebra and Analytic Geometry#Linear Maps, Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues#Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors#More properties|eigenvalues]]
are real, $|\mathrm{Hess}\;f(x_0,y_0)| = \lambda_1\lambda_2$ and $\mathrm{tr}(\mathrm{Hess}\;f(x_0,y_0)) = \lambda_1 + \lambda_2$.

Suppose the second partial derivatives of $f$ are continuous in a disk centered at $(x_0,y_0)$.
Suppose also that $\nabla f(x_0,y_0) = \begin{bmatrix}0\\0\end{bmatrix}$.
Then
1. If $|\mathrm{Hess}\; f(x_0,y_0)| > 0$ and $\mathrm{tr}(\mathrm{Hess}\; f(x_0,y_0)) > 0$,
   then $f$ has a local minimum at $(x_0,y_0)$.
2. If $|\mathrm{Hess}\; f(x_0,y_0)| > 0$ and $\mathrm{tr}(\mathrm{Hess}\; f(x_0,y_0)) < 0$,
   then $f$ has a local maximum at $(x_0,y_0)$.
3. If $|\mathrm{Hess}\; f(x_0,y_0)| < 0$, then $(x_0,y_0)$ is not a local extremum;
   instead, $(x_0,y_0)$ is a saddle point.

==== Global Extrema ====

With the set $D \subset \mathbb{R}^2$:
* A point $(x,y)$ is called an *interior point* of $D$ if there exists a $\delta > 0$
  such that the disk centered at $(x,y)$ with radius $\delta$ is contained in $D$,
  that is if $B_\delta(x,y) \subset D$.
* A point $(x,y)$ is a *boundary point* of $D$
  if every disk centered at $(x,y)$ contains both points in $D$ and points not in $D$;
  the boundary point $(x,y)$ need not be contained in $D$.
* The *interior* of $D$ consists of all interior points of $D$.
* The *boundary* of $D$ consists of all boundary points of $D$.
* A set $D \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ is *open*
  if it consists only of interior points.
* A set $D \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ is *closed*
  if it contains all its boundary points as well as its interior points.
* A set is *bounded* if it is contained within some disk.

*Extreme-Value Theorem in* $\mathbb{R}^2$

If $f$ is continuous on a closed and bounded set $D \subset \mathbb{R}^2$,
then $f$ has both a global maximum and a global minimum on $D$.

To find global extrema for continuous functions defined in a closed bounded set:
1. Determine all candidates for local extrema in the interior of $D$.
2. Determine all candidates for local extrema on the boundary of $D$.
3. Select the global maximum and the global minimum from the set of points determined in steps 1 and 2.

=== Extrema with Constraints ===

*Lagrange's Theorem*

Assume that $f$ and $g$ have continuous first partial derivatives
and that $f(x,y)$ has an extremum at $(x_0,y_0)$
subject to the constraint $g(x,y) = 0$.
If $\nabla g(x,y) \neq \begin{bmatrix}0\\0\end{bmatrix}$,
then there exists a number $\lambda$ such that
{{$
  \nabla f(x_0,y_0) = \lambda \nabla g(x_0,y_0)
}}$
