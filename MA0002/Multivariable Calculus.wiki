= Multivariable Calculus =

== Functions of Two or More Independent Variables ==

== Limits and Continuity ==

=== Limits ===

*Limit Laws for the Two-Dimensional Case*

If $a$ is a constant and if
{{$
\begin{align}
  \lim_{(x,y) \to (x_0,y_0)} & f(x,y) = L_1 \\ & \text{and} \\ \lim_{(x,y) \to (x_0,y_0)} & g(x,y) = L_2
\end{align}
}}$
where $L_1$ and $L_2$ are real numbers, then the following hold:

=== Continuity ===

A function $f(x,y)$ is continuous at $(x_0, y_0)$ if the following hold:
1. $f(x,y)$ is defined at $(x_0, y_0)$
2. $\lim_{(x,y) \to (x_0,y_0)} f(x,y)$ exists.
3. $\lim_{(x,y) \to (x_0,y_0)} f(x,y) = (x_0, y_0)$

== Partial Derivatives ==

*Definition*

If $f$ is a function of two independent variables $x$ and $y$,
the *partial derivative* of $f$ with respect to $x$ is defined by
{{$
  \frac{\partial f(x,y)}{\partial x} = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x+h,y) - f(x,y)}{h}
}}$
The partial derivative of $f$ withe respect to $y$ is defined by
{{$
  \frac{\partial f(x,y)}{\partial y} = \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{f(x,y+h) - f(x,y)}{h}
}}$

*Notation*

$f_x(x,y) = \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}$

$f_{yx} = \frac{\partial^2f}{\partial x \partial y} = \frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\right)$

*Computation*

To compute $\frac{\partial f(x,y)}{\partial x}$ we treat $y$ as a constant and differentiate $f$ with respect to $x$.

*Disks are two-dimensional analogues to intervals*

An *open disk* with radius $r$ centered at $(x_0,y_0) \in \mathbb{R}^2$ is the set
{{$
B_r(x_0,y_0) = \left\{ (x,y) \in \mathbb{R}^2 : \sqrt{(x-x_0)^2-(y-y_0)^2} < r \right\}
}}$
A *closed disk* with radius $r$ centered at $(x_0,y_0) \in \mathbb{R}^2$ is the set
{{$
\overline{B}_r(x_0,y_0) = \left\{ (x,y) \in \mathbb{R}^2 : \sqrt{(x-x_0)^2-(y-y_0)^2} \leq r \right\}
}}$

*The Mixed-Derivative Theorem*

If $f(x,y)$ and its partial derivatives $f_x,f_y,f_{xy},f_{yx}$
are continuous on an open disk centered at the point $(x_0,y_0)$, then
{{$
 f_{xy}(x_0,y_0) = f_{yx}(x_0,y_0)
}}$

== Tangent Planes, Differentiability and Linearization ==

=== Functions of Two Variables ===

==== Tangent Planes ====

If the tangent plane to the surface $z = f(x,y)$ at the point $(x_0, y_0, z_0)$ exists,
then the tangent plane has the equation
{{$
z - z_0 = \frac{\partial f(x_0,y_0)}{\partial x}(x-x_0) + \frac{\partial f(x_0,y_0)}{\partial y}(y-y_0)
}}$

    Basically 2d equivalent of a tangent line.

==== Differentiability ====

Suppose that $f(x,y)$ is a function of two independent variables
and that both $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}$ and $\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}$
are defined throughout an open disk containing $(x_0,y_0)$.
    Some circle of inputs where the function works.
Set
{{$
L(x,y) = f(x_0,y_0) + \frac{\partial f(x_0,y_0)}{\partial x}(x-x_0) + \frac{\partial f(x_0,y_0)}{\partial y}(y-y_0)
}}$
    Linearize the function (tangent plane).
Then $f(x,y)$ is differentiable at $(x_0,y_0)$ if
{{$
\lim_{(x,y) \to (x_0,y_0)} \left| \frac{f(x,y) - L(x,y)}{\sqrt{(x-x_0)^2-(y-y_0)^2}} \right| = 0
}}$
    Difference between the actual function and the linearized version divided by the distance from point of linearization.
    The function is differentiable if the linearization and the function agrees at given point.
Furthermore, if $f(x,y)$ is differentiable at $(x_0,y_0)$,
then $z = L(x,y)$ defines the tangent plane to the graph of $f$ at $(x_0,y_0,f(x_0,y_0))$.
We say that $f(x,y)$ is differentiable if it is differentiable at every point of its domain.

*Theorem*

If $f(x,y)$ is differentiable at $(x_0,y_0)$, then $f$ is continuous at $(x_0,y_0)$.

*Sufficient Condition For Differentiability*

Suppose $f(x,y)$ is defined on an open disk centered at $(x_0,y_0)$
and the partial derivativesÂ $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}$ and $\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}$
are continuous on an open disk centered at $(x_0,y_0)$.
Then $f(x,y)$ is differentiable at $(x_0,y_0)$.

==== Linearization ====

Suppose that $f(x,y)$ is differentiable at $(x_0,y_0)$.
The linearization of $f(x,y)$ at $(x_0,y_0)$ is the function
{{$
L(x,y) = f(x_0,y_0) + \frac{\partial f(x_0,y_0)}{\partial x}(x-x_0) + \frac{\partial f(x_0,y_0)}{\partial y}(y-y_0)
}}$
The approximation
{{$
f(x,y) \approx L(x,y)
}}$
is the *standard linear approximation*, or the *tangent plane approximation*, of $f(x,y)$ at $(x_0,y_0)$.

=== Vector-Valued Functions ===

Vector-valued functions $\vec{f}:\mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m$
{{$
\vec{f}(x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n) =
\begin{bmatrix}
  f_1(x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n) \\
  f_2(x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n) \\
  \vdots \\
  f_m(x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n)
\end{bmatrix}
}}$
where $f_i : \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}, i = 1,2,\dots,n$,
are real-valued functions of $n$ independent variables,
then the *Jacobi matrix* is an $m \times n$ matrix of the form
{{$
D\vec{f} =
\begin{bmatrix}
  \frac{\partial f_1}{\partial x_1} & \ldots & \frac{\partial f_1}{\partial x_n} \\
  \vdots & & \vdots \\
  \frac{\partial f_m}{\partial x_1} & \ldots & \frac{\partial f_m}{\partial x_n}
\end{bmatrix}
}}$
The linearization of $\vec{f}$ about the point $(x_1^*, x_2^*, \dots, x_n^*)$ is then
{{$
L(x_1^*, \dots, x_n^*) =
\begin{bmatrix}
  f_1(x_1^*,\dots,x_n^*) \\
  f_2(x_1^*,\dots,x_n^*) \\
  \vdots \\
  f_m(x_1^*,\dots,x_n^*)
\end{bmatrix}
+
D\vec{f}(x_1^*, \dots, x_n^*)
\begin{bmatrix}
  x_1 - x_1^* \\
  \vdots \\
  x_n - x_n^*
\end{bmatrix}
}}$

== More About Derivatives ==

=== The Chain Rule for Functions of Two Variables ===

If $w = f(x,y)$ is differentiable and $x$ and $y$ are differentiable functions of $t$,
then $w$ is a differentiable function for $t$ and
{{$
  \frac{dw}{dt} = \frac{\partial w}{\partial x}\frac{dx}{dt} + \frac{\partial w}{\partial y}\frac{dy}{dy}
}}$

=== Implicit Differentiation ===

If a function $F(x,y)$ is differentiable, with $x = f(x)$ and $y = g(x)$,
and $F(x,y) = 0$ defines $y$ implicitly as a differentiable function of $x$,
Then, at any point where $F_y \neq 0$,
{{$
  \frac{dy}{dx} = -\frac{F_x}{F_y}
}}$

=== Directional Derivatives and Gradient Vectors ===

Assume that $z = f(x,y)$ is a function of two independent variables
and that $\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}$ and $\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}$ exist. Then the vector
{{$
  \nabla f(x,y) = \begin{bmatrix}
    \frac{\partial f(x,y)}{\partial x} \\
    \frac{\partial f(x,y)}{\partial y}
  \end{bmatrix}
}}$
is called the gradient of $f$ at $(x,y)$.

The directional derivative of $f(x,y)$ at $(x_0,y_0)$
in the direction of the unit vector $\vec{u}=\begin{bmatrix}u_1 \\ u_2\end{bmatrix}$ is
{{$
  D_{\vec{u}}f(x_0,y_0) = (\nabla f(x_0,y_0)) \cdot \vec{u}
}}$
