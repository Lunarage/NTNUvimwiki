= Integration Techniques and Computational Methods =

== The Substitution Rule ==
=== Indefinite Integrals ===

Reverse Chain Rule

If $u=g(x)$, then
{{$
\int f[g(x)]g'(x) \,dx = \int f(u) \,du
}}$

=== Definite Integrals ===

If $u=g(x)$, then
{{$
\int_{a}^{b} f[g(x)]g'(x) \,dx = \int_{g(a)}^{g(b)} f(u) \,du
}}$

== Integration by Parts and Practicing Integration ==

=== Integration by Parts ===

Reverse Product Rule

If $u(x)$ and $v(x)$ are differentiable functions, then
{{$
\int u(x)v'(x) \,dx = u(x)v(x) - \int u'(x)v(x) \, dx
}}$
or, in short form,
{{$
\int u \,dv = uv - \int v \,du
}}$

== Rational Functions and Partial Fractions ==

A rational function is
{{$
  f(x)=\frac{P(x)}{Q(x)}
}}$
where $P(x)$ and $Q(x)$ are polynomials.
