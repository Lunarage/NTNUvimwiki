A system of linear Differential Equations:

{{$
\begin{align}
  \frac{dx_1}{dt} & = a_{11}x_1 + a_{12}x_2 \\
  \frac{dx_2}{dt} & = a_{21}x_1 + a_{22}x_2
\end{align}
}}$

Matrix form:

{{$
\frac{d\vec{x}}{dt} = A\vec{x}
}}$

Let $A$ be a $2 \times 2$ matrix with two real and distinct eigenvalues $\lambda_1$Â and $\lambda_2$
with corresponding eigenvectors $\vec{u}$ and $\vec{v}$.
Then
{{$
\vec{x} = c_1e^{\lambda_1t}\vec{u} + c_2e^{\lambda_2t}\vec{v}
}}$
is the general solution.
